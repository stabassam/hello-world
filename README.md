# hello-world
My first repo on Github, yay. I'm Shahraiz and even though I've been designing and developing some pretty cool things, I just mustered up the courage to move to Git. I think this is very cool and that it's going to be an awesome way to manage versioning and collaboration.

EDIT: just made this edit on my local machine after pulling the repo and will now be pushing it to my remote repo.

EDIT: Pushing this the second time just to make sure I've gotten the hang of it. This is so cool. :')
